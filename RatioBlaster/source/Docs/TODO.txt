-----------------------------
TODO :
+ Added drag and drop torrent to the main RB list, need to check why is there randomising in Form_Load ???

+ Removed versionChecker file from RM, Added version checker to RB, need to finalize.
	Added variable internalVersion to Programs.cs . This will be used for comparison with version on moofdev server.
	
+ Added general log  tab .Function AddLogLine inside clsFMain.cs
	use - Program.mainUI.AddLogLine("blbala");
	
+ Fixed useDNS function, for some reason it wasnt used in RB. Its important to calculate localip for Azureus emulation and maybe others .
 This function was changed to getLocalIp and moved to clsFmain from Rm.

- Need to add dialog with global RB options such as : checkbox for Check New Version and so on.	: done, phis

- Need to change and cleanup 'About Dialog'. Need to remove license stuff (this is what readme for).
 Plus needs to put links to moofdev forum and help page,proxy help page aqnd contact information as was in 1.7.5 .
 
- Need to do clear button per log or right click menu to remove log messages.Right click even better.

- Need to add "Properties" submenu to right click on listview.It should open RM with first torrent details .
  This way user should be able to change options while torrent is running : such as proxy settings, tcp listener, scrape and so on.

- saving of main window size, position and size of columns

- good to have selectable and configurable columns . Low Priority.
